# LikeCoin Smart Contracts

This is the repo of the Ethereum smart contracts related to the [LikeCoin](https://like.community/).

The contracts are tested using the [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) framework.

The tests are written in ES2017 syntax (for `async` `await`), so newer version of NodeJS (>= 7.6) is needed.
